Misinformation has always been dangerous and divisive, but especially so in the wake of "fake news" and Covid-19 conspiracy theories. How can we, as scholars, librarians, and citizens, combat the spread of misinformation? What challenges might we encounter while doing this work?

We were delighted to host Abeer Siddiqui, a celebrated teacher with a record of empowering students and engaging communities, at this talk. Siddiqui will discuss her research on the challenges of addressing misinformation in public libraries and explore how her recent project informs her longstanding work on storytelling and science communication as a Learning Support Librarian and Adjunct Professor in the School of Interdisciplinary Science.
