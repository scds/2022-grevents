# Welcome to Science Communication and Digital Activism: 2022 SCDS Graduate Resident Events

Each year, the Sherman Centre's Graduate Residents are invited to conceptualize an event related to their research interests. In 2022, this resulted in a suite of four events: two panels where SCDS Graduate Residents shared their work-in-progress research and two guest lectures by speakers whose work intersected with the Residents' research interests. 

Navigate to the "Science Communication and Digital Scholarship" module to watch recordings of the Graduate Panel featuring Cameron Anderson, Duygu Ertemin, Brianne Morgan, and Akacia Propst, and the Guest Lecture by Abeer Siddiqui, Science Librarian, McMaster University.
